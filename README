:::CHANGING OSC IP/PORT SEND/RECEIVE SETTINGS:::

You can change Sender IP:PORT and Receiver Port by commandline arguments:

open terminal and go to folder DarwiinRemote.app/Contents/MacOS
./DarwiinRemote <send ip> <send port> <rcv port>

to set for example send ip to 192.168.0.2, sender port to 5610 and receiver port to 5611
./DarwiinRemote 192.168.0.2 5610 5611

this is very useful if you connect multiple wii controllers!
-> start multiple instances with different port settings...
